# Requirements  

## Three or more pages:  
   - The website includes **four pages**: Home, Blog Posts, About, and Tips.  

## A clear, well-organized layout with strong usability:  
   - The layout is designed with Bootstrap's grid system, ensuring responsiveness and easy navigation through a prominent navbar and neatly organized content sections.  

## Use of an external stylesheet:  
   - The website links to an external CSS file (`tips-styles.css`) to manage styling, separating design from structure.  

## Apply at least one font:  
   - I used the **Google Font "Open Sans"** throughout the website for a clean, modern look. Additionally, the heading on the Home page uses "Georgia" for contrast.  

## At least one image:  
   - The website features at least one image, such as on the Blog Posts page, where images visually complement the content.  

## At least one embedded media element (video, audio, Google Maps, etc.):  
   - Embedded media is included as links on the Tips page, like the **Notion** and **Google Calendar** links for planning and scheduling.  

## Structural and semantic HTML markup with a clean and organized page layout:  
   - I used semantic tags like header, footer, nav, section, and article for clear, accessible content structure.  

## Legible, well-commented, and error-free code:  
   - The code is clean, readable, and free of errors. While I could add more comments for clarity, I think the structure and flow make sense and meet the requirements.
