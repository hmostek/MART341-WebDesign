I've decided that I would like to continue with a Portfolio for my website. Ifeel that it covers wanting to be playful and professional, as I can use it on my resume. (If done correctly.) I look forward to personalizing it and showcasing my achievements!

Reflection...
I honestly tried applying balance by adding some color and aligning the text within the site. 
The final design doesn't quite meet my initial idea, but that's what the next few weeks and assignments will help fix. 
I had challenges with styling and hyperlinks, but I figured them out with a little help Google.
