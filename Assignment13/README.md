My website has everything needed to meet the requirements! It has four pages: Home, Recipes, About, and Contact, all tied together with a cohesive theme. The design is responsive and adjusts smoothly across different screen sizes, thanks to CSS media queries. The navigation menu is simple and easy to use, with links to all the main pages. I’ve also added a dropdown menu in the navigation for a few sub-pages like Blog. Everything’s designed to be easy to navigate and look great on any device.
