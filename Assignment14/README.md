To incorporate Bootstrap and HTML5 into my website code, I first added the Bootstrap CSS link in the `<head>` section of your HTML document. This gives my site access to Bootstrapâ€™s responsive grid system, pre-designed components, and utilities. For HTML5, I used elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`, which provided a clear structure and improve accessibility. I also added the `meta` tag for viewport settings to make my site mobile-friendly. By doing this, I made my site responsive and visually appealing without much custom CSS.
