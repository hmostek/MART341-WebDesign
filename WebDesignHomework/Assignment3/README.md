# Questions Regarding this Weeks Material?
## I don't have any questions with markdown language...

I had to go back and try and understand why I am having such a hard time developing my website and repositories on VSC, as well as the github desktop program. So I am in the process of redoing my week 2-6 assignments. I hope that the repetition and paying more attention to detail will aid in fully completing my assignments and getting a decent grade in this class. I'm adding another sentence into this just to be safe. 

**Bold Text**
*Italicized Text*

List of what I would like to get by redoing these assignments 
- clear understanding of VSC
- a working website/link
- hopefully 100%'s on my assignments
