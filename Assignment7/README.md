I'm most proud of my contact form in this assignment. I feel it looks really neat, and I'm pumped that it works and can send an actual message to my email. For the design aspect, I love the somplcity of it and how it's the focal point of that page specifically. Then, the finctionality of the button and the ability to send the message straight to my email, is so cool to me. I think as a whole, that feature stands out becuase of how much work I put into it.
