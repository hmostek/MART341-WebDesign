# In this updated code, I used the following six techniques to enhance and style my portfolio page:

1. ## Sizing: 
   - The width of elements was controlled, particularly with `max-width` on `main` and `footer`, limiting them to 800px for better readability and structure on larger screens.
   
2. ## Overflow: 
   - I applied `overflow: hidden;` to the `nav` and `header` to manage any overflow content, ensuring that elements within these sections stay neatly contained.

3. ## Border: 
   - The borders were added to `section` elements to separate and emphasize each section, matching the overall theme with a subtle `1px solid #d1a7cc` border.

4. ## Margin: 
   - Using margins on sections (`margin: 20px 0;`) and `main` (`margin: 80px auto 0;`) to create clear space between sections and around the page content, improving readability and layout flow.

5. ## Padding: 
   - By enhancing padding within elements, such as `section`, `p`, and `address`, creating better spacing between the content and borders. This makes the content easier to read and visually distinct.

6. ## Dropdown:
   - I implemented a dropdown menu within `nav` using `dropdown` and `dropdown-content` classes, allowing more navigation options within the existing menu structure.

Each technique was applied to improve the layout, readability, and interactivity of my portfolio page.
