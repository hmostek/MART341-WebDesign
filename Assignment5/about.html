<h1>WHy I Chose These Website Ideas</h1>
<br />
<h2>Portflio!</h2>
<p>I chose a portfolio because I have experiencing making them. I also believed that it would be a good material to add to my resume. This is probably the website design I will continue to work on throughout the remainder of the class.</p>
<br /> 
<h2>Personal Blog!</h2>
<p>This website design would be fun to create! I could make it super personal and basically turn it into an online diary.</p>
<br />
<h2>Small Business Website!</h2>
<p>This website design would be fun, because I could be creative and promote a fake product. However, out of the three this is the one I'm least likely to do.</p>
