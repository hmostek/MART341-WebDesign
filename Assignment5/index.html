<h1>Website Ideas for Assignment 5</h1>

<h2>Personal Blog</h2>
<p>A personal blog is an online platform where individuals share their thoughts, experiences, and interests through written posts. It often features a variety of content, including stories, opinions, and tutorials, allowing for personal expression and connection with an audience. Readers can encage with the content through comments and shares, fostering a sense of community around the blog's themes. My personal blog would have a personable, and playful feel.</p>

<h2>Portfolio</h2>
<p>A portfolio is a curated collection of an individual's work that showcases their skills, accomplishments, and creative abilities. It often includes examples of completed projects, case studies, and testimonials to demonstrate expertise in a particular field. Portfolios are commonly used by artists, designers, writers, and professionals to attract clients or employers and highlight their style and capabilities. I have an online portfolio, that I made for my intro to honors class, as well as my digital design class in high school. These types of sites should have a more professional feel, but it should be personalized to fit your work/style of projects.</p>

<h2>Small Business Website</h2>
<p>A small business website serves as an online presence for a company, providing essential information about its products, services, and brand. It often includes features like an about page, contact details, and e-commerce capabilities to facilitate customer interactions and sales. Additionally, a well-designed website helps build credibility, attract new customers, and enhance marketing efforts through SEO and online visibility. This site should be the most professional of all three because it's a space to "sell" your product or service.</p>
